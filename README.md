# EAP Operation Manual

Hello and welcome to the team! In addition to the responsibilities associated
with your role, you are now also an operator of a new-to-you EAP. This document
is intended to ensure you are able to get the most from our working relationship.
It attempts to capture my management philosophy, day-to-day work expectations,
and other quirks with which you may wish to familiarize yourself. It is not a
replacement for the actual working relationship we will develop over time, but
is a useful document to check assumptions and hold me accountable.

It is in the spirit of [similar documents](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/)
from other leaders who inspire me.

## Guiding Principles
__Motivations matter.__ I believe teams are healthiest when team members are
primarily motivated by factors beyond their own personal gain. I reward and
praise work done in service of our customers or our mission. I do not reward or
praise work done for self-promotion or other self-interest.

__People are the plan.__ I believe that happy people are a prerequisite to
delivering great work, and that people are happiest when they are understood. I
will always make time to listen, and try to ensure you are heard.

__Leaders should be doers.__ I have greater respect for leaders who _have done_
/ _can do_ / and _will do_ when necessary. I don't believe a leader can be
effective without a deep understanding of what and how their team delivers.

__Doers should be leaders.__ Leadership comes in many forms. I recognize that
people managers are a necessity when scaling organizations; I also recognize
that organizations cannot effectively scale without leadership qualities
exhibited by individuals at all levels.

__Iteration and experimentation.__ Things are not perfect now, but they'll only
get better if we regularly reflect, give and accept feedback, and make small
changes to everything continuously.


## Day-to-day Operations
__1:1s.__ I recognize the value in meeting regularly with individuals on the
team, but I don't like the term _one-on-one_; it sounds too sterile and
corporate. Instead, I prefer calling these meetings __Syncs__, in recognition
that you will ordinarily be operating asynchronously (with a fair amount of
autonomy), but that we occasionally need to synchronize.

We'll meet once a week for 30 minutes (to start; we can adjust this as our
working relationship evolves). I've created [a collaborative document](#) that
only you and I can access which we'll use to shape the agenda of each sync. Any
time a question, topic, or thought of substance comes to mind, put it in the doc.
I will do the same. My expectation is that you will drive most of the agenda for
our syncs.

__Meetings.__ I'm in a lot of meetings. We could be a lot better as an
organization about how we run meetings. My expectation is that meetings have an
agenda (or a goal with a plan for achieving that goal) in the scheduled time. I
will ask for this from a meeting organizer before accepting an invitation. I
encourage you to do the same.

Before you book a meeting, think about whether or not you could achieve the same
outcome using Slack or an email. 

__Communication.__ There are many ways to communicate with people. I try to be
aware and use the right means for the message: email is permanent, in-person and
video conversations are ephemeral, and Slack is somewhere in between. I ask that
you also be thoughtful with your communications.

__On the clock.__ My philosophy on working hours is guided by the principles
outlined above (happy people beget great work). I encourage you to optimize your
work time, balancing the needs associated with your role, your customers, the
team, and your happiness. Work with me as this balance evolves.

I will occasionally send you an email or Slack message late in the evening or on
a weekend. Working at these times is my choice; I don't expect you to respond
outside of your normal work hours.


## Et Cetera
__Thoughtful communications.__ I believe the single greatest lever we have to
control the reality around us is communication: what we say (and what we don't
say), to whom, and how it's said.

__You will get a more thoughtful response from me in writing.__ I don't
necessarily like writing, but I'm a compulsive editor. I use the written word to
communicate important or impactful things. Write to me for a more thoughtful
response than what you'd get in-person.

__My inbox is a todo list__, for better or for worse. Don't hesitate to update 
the thread and push your note back to the top of the list.

__Just enough is the right amount of process.__ I am allergic to process for
process' sake. I don't like teams that adopt Agile without respect to the
context of their organization or the principles behind the methodology. I will
err on the side of less process and you may need to challenge me on this.

__I am an introvert__, meaning I expend more energy than I take in when I am
around people. I may be quiet at times, especially in larger groups, but I am
engaged.

__I am here to learn.__ Your EAP does not operate in a vacuum and requires
regular updates. My hope is to learn from you.

This document [evolves](https://github.com/iamEAP/how-to-eap). I will update it
from time to time and would appreciate your feedback.
